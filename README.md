# Precise identification of twenty amino acids and discrimination of peptides with functionalized nanopore
This repository contains the codes to detect and measure properties of ionic current blockades from a current vs time recording of single-molecule amino acid identification, as well as the scripts and algorithms for downstream artificial intelligence classification model and visualization. Developed by Chao Tang at the Lu Chen's Lab, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.

    For the convenience of sharing and spread, we also developed an R package named `AANanopore` to process and extract the amino acid signal from raw ABF file.  The AANanopore package are located in https://github.com/LuChenLab/AANanoporeR.git, user can install it by devtools::install_github("LuChenLab/AANanoporeR‚Äù), and all of the user manual can also accesed at https://github.com/LuChenLab/AANanoporeR.git.
